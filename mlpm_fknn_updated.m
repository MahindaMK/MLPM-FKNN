% based on the study:

    % Kumbure, M. M., Lohrmann, C., Luukka, P.: A Study on Relevant Features for Intraday S&P 500 Prediction 
    % Using a Hybrid Feature Selection Approach. International Conference on Machine Learning, 
    % Optimization, and Data Science (LOD - 2021), Grasmere, Lake District, England â€“ UK (2021). 

% INPUTS:
    % xtrain: Train data is a n-by-m data matrix consisting of n samples and m features(variables)
    % ytrain: n dimensional class vector of xtrain data (class labels should be in numerical form, eg. 1,2)
    % xtest: Test data is a D-by-m data matrix consisting of D samples and m features
    % ytest: D dimensional class vector of xtest data
    % K: Number of nearest neighbors to be selected
    % p: Parameter value for Power mean operator

% OUTPUTS:
    % predicted: Predicted class label for each test sample in xtest
    % memberships: Fuzzy class memberships values for each test sample in xtest
    % numhits: Number of correctly predicted test samples
    
    % 'pmean.m' is needed. 
    % This file is needed to compute power mean vectors of the set of nearest neighbor in each class

num_test  = size(xtest,1);  % Find the number of samples in the test set

m = 2.0; % scaling factor for fuzzy weights

max_class = max(ytrain);

% Aallocate space for storing predicted labels, resulted numhits and memberships
predicted = zeros(num_test, length(K));
numhits = zeros(length(K),1);
memberships = zeros(num_test, max_class, length(K));

% For each test samples, do:

for i = 1:num_test
    
    % Take the class labels
    class_labels = unique(ytrain);
    
    % Go through in each class in the training data
    for ii=1:length(class_labels)
    train_data_class_ii = xtrain(ytrain==class_labels(ii),:); % Find the train samples in class ii
    num_train_ii  = size(train_data_class_ii,1); % Take the number of samples in class ii
    
    % Computer the Euclidean distances from the test sample to each train pattern in class ii, 
    % (for efficiency, no need to take sqrt since it is a non-decreasing function)
    distances   = (repmat(xtest(i,:), num_train_ii,1) - train_data_class_ii).^2;

    % Find the indexes of nearest neighbors from class ii

    % Compute fuzzy weights:
        % Though this weight calculation should be: 
        % weight = distances(neighbor_index).^(-2/(m-1)), 
        % but since we did not take sqrt above and the inverse 
        % 2th power the weights are: weight = sqrt(distances(neighbor_index)).^(-2/(m-1));
        % which is equaliavent to:
 	    weight = distances.^(-1/(m-1));
 
 	    % Set the Inf (infite) weights, if there are any, to  1.
